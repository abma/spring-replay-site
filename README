Spring Replay Site
------------------

Website to upload, download, search and comment replays created by games
running on the SpringRTS engine (http://springrts.com).

Runs on Django / Python (https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Development is done using Django 1.4 and Python 2.7, but it will probably run
(with minor modifications?) with Django 1.2 and Python 2.6.
